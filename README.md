# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we look at the New York City Citi Bike data to see if it is possible to make a bike sharing program is a successful business proposal. An analysis is done on the data to figure out the best parts of the New York City bike sharing to figure out how to implement it to other cities and make it successful.

### Tools used
**Tableau**

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset
From the images above that dealt with gender, males were a major consumer of bike sharing. Also, people that subscribed to the service were more likely to use the service. This is good to know as the analysis can help with focusing on how to advertise a similar service in another city.
The other images show that bike services are good for short trips and could be successful with workers as the usage matches with typical opening and closing hours of work. This also helps us determine that it is best to work on the maintenance and charging overnight.

The few vizualizations that would help with seeing the best methods of the bike sharing service would be age demographics to see if college students and recent graduates are the majority subscribers and starting/ending locations compared to population density to see if the service only works in urban settings or could be feasible in suburban settings as well.
